                    <p class="lead">The
                        <strong>New Zealand Palaeotsunami Database</strong> (Database) brings together all known information about
                        tsunamis that occurred prior to written records.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this Database is to increase awareness of New Zealand's tsunami hazard and facilitate
                        processing and analysis of palaeotsunami information. It consolidates a wide range of published and
                        unpublished research contributions from a range of institutions and science providers, both domestic
                        and overseas, on palaeotsunamis in Aotearoa-New Zealand. The Database is based on the work of former
                        NIWA earth scientist, Professor James Goff of the University of New South Wales, Australia; and is
                        provided by the National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research Ltd (NIWA) and the Ministry
                        for Civil Defence and Emergency Management (MCDEM) (together, the Providers)

                        </sup>. This information is freely available to you.</p>
                    <p>Each line of data in the Database summarises the evidence related to one site under a series of headings
                        including physical evidence from geological and archaeological sources as well as cultural information
                        from anthropological and cross-disciplinary studies. The Database currently contains 436 line items
                        and most likely describes more than 50 palaeotsunami events. Data include: site information, nature
                        of the evidence, chronology and dating techniques, maximum water heights, horizontal inundation distances,
                        sources and supporting meta-data for specific locations. The Database is not intended to be complete
                        however, rather as research progresses iterations will be made to remove erroneous data and add new
                        data.</p>
