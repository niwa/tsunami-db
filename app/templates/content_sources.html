                    <h1>Tsunami Sources</h1>
                    <p class="lead">Tsunami waves are typically caused when an earthquake, landslide or volcanic eruption disturbs the
                        ocean or other body of water.</p>
                    <h2>Tsunami Generation</h2>
                    <p>Earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions and bolide (asteroid) impacts can all generate tsunamis.</p>
                    <p>Tsunamis are typically categorised as ‘local source’ (also called ‘near field’) or ’distant source’
                        (‘far field’) depending on how far the tsunami travels from its source to where it washes ashore.
                        A distant source tsunami is one which causes damage or serious effects at locations large distances
                        from the source region while the effects of a near field or ‘local’ tsunami are close to the
                        tsunami source region. For example: a tsunami that is triggered by an earthquake off the coast
                        of Peru will be a local source tsunami for Peru but a distant source for New Zealand.</p>
                    <p>For New Zealand, Power (2013) grouped tsunami sources according to the following definitions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Distant source – 3 hours or greater travel time from New Zealand</li>
                        <li>Regional source – 1–3 hours travel time from New Zealand</li>
                        <li>Local source – 0–60 minutes travel time to the nearest New Zealand coast</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Earthquake-generated tsunamis</h2>
                    <p>Tsunamis are generated by earthquakes on faults that cause the sea floor to be either pushed up or
                        pulled down. ‘Thrust’ or ‘reverse’ faults generally cause sea bed uplift, while ‘normal’ faults
                        generally cause part of the seafloor to suddenly drop down.</p>
                    <p>The top 5-10 km of the earth’s crust are made up of rigid plates that slowly move around the surface
                        of the earth. In places where plates are moving together, one plate may be pushed under the other.
                        This is called ‘subduction’ and regions where this is happening across large areas are called
                        ‘subduction zones’. Much of the Pacific Ocean is rimmed by subduction zones. This is the so called
                        ‘Ring of Fire’ known for frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>Most destructive tsunamis have been caused by thrust earthquakes along subduction zones such as those
                        found around the Pacific Rim and the Sunda Arc, south and west of Indonesia. Notable recent examples
                        include the Pacific tsunamis of 1960 (Chile); 1964 (Alaska); 2011 (Japan) and the 2004 Indian
                        Ocean Tsunami (north Sumatra).</p>
                    <p>Another common way tsunamis are generated is by an “outer-rise earthquake” where normal faulting
                        causes large-scale, sudden subsidence in the oceanic floor seaward of a subduction zone trench.
                        The 1933 Sanriku and 2009 Samoa (South Pacific) tsunamis are examples of this type of tsunami.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>Tsunamis have also been caused through strike-slip faulting where the fault moves the seafloor sideways
                        rather than up or down. These types of tsunami may well be associated with submarine slumps or
                        landslides which contribute to the overall strength of the tsunami and its impact.</p>
                    <p>There is a special class of subduction zone thrust-type earthquakes where the tsunami that is formed
                        is much larger than would be expected based on the earthquake magnitude alone. These events are
                        called ‘tsunami earthquakes’ (Kanamori, 1972). Generally the earthquake happens on the shallower
                        portion of the subduction zone, the seafloor ruptures slowly, the seismic energy is released
                        more slowly, and the sea floor deformation is larger compared to other earthquakes of the same
                        magnitude. Each of these factors contributes to an overall larger tsunami, particularly close
                        to the source. Examples of this type of event include Sanriku Japan, 1896; Nicaragua, 1992; East
                        Java, Indonesia, 1994; West Java Indonesia, 2006 and the Mentawai Islands, Indonesia, 2010.</p>
                    <h2>Landslide-generated tsunamis</h2>
                    <p>Tsunamis can also be generated by slope failures – commonly referred to as landslides, slumps, slips
                        or debris flows. If the landslide happens above the water, tsunami waves are generated as the
                        material crashes onto the water surface, and water is displaced. If the landslide happens under
                        the water, on the seafloor, the water above the landslide is pulled downwards in to the hole
                        that is left as the landslide material slides down slope. This disruption of the water causes
                        a tsunami.</p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>The key factors controlling the height of the wave that forms are: the slope of the sea bed; the
                        amount of material displaced; the thickness of the landslide; the depth of water at which the
                        landslide occurs; the speed at which the landslide moves and the distance over which the slide
                        material travels (Bardet et al., 2003). Critical to the study of landslide-generated tsunamis
                        is the ability to tell how often these events happen in a given place. This is particularly true
                        for the large scale “flank collapse” of volcanic islands, a rare but potentially catastrophic
                        tsunami generator (Ward, 2002).</p>
                    <p>The most famous and extreme example of a landslide-generated tsunami is the one that happened in
                        Lituya Bay, in south eastern Alaska on July 9, 1958. In this event, an on-land earthquake along
                        the Fairweather Fault caused a landslide made up of 30 million cubic meters of rock and soil
                        to collapse into the head of Lituya Bay. The wave caused by this landslide reached a height of
                        524 m above sea level. Wave heights reduced to ~10 m at the mouth of the bay (Miller, 1960).
                        A submarine landslide is also considered to have been the main cause of the 1998 Papua New Guinea
                        tsunami which killed more than 2100 people (Synolakis et al., 2002).</p>
                    <h2>Volcanoes and other generating mechanisms</h2>
                    <p>Tsunamis can form as the result of a volcanic eruption – especially if the eruption causes a caldera
                        collapse and results in the displacement of a large volume of water. Volcanic eruptions and associated
                        earthquakes can produce landslides on land which then fall into a body of water causing a wave.
                        The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa in the Sunda Strait between the Islands of Sumatra and Java is
                        the most significant historic example of this phenomenon (Winchester, 2005).</p>
                    <p>The weather can cause tsunamis, or tsunami-like waves. This is called ‘meteorological forcing’ and
                        the wave that is formed is called a ‘meteotsunami’. This most commonly happens with the movement
                        of an area of low atmospheric pressure across a body of water. The low atmospheric pressure causes
                        a displacement of the water surface (water level rises with low pressure). If the low pressure
                        system moves through the air above the water, it can produce a wave-like feature that moves across
                        the water. If the speed of the low pressure system matches the local speed of the induced water
                        wave, this can cause a build-up of wave height (see: Dean and Dalrymple, 1991; p. 163-166). An
                        example of this effect includes the tsunami-like wave that hit Daytona Beach, Florida on the
                        night of July 3rd&nbsp;1992 (Sallenger et al., 1995).</p>
                    <p>A further tsunami generation mechanism is that caused by a bolide (e.g. asteroid) impact in an ocean
                        basin. No such event is known to have occurred in human history, but attempts have been made
                        to work out the probability of such an occurrence (Chapman and Morrison, 2000) and the size of
                        the waves it might generate (Ward and Asphaug, 2000).</p>
