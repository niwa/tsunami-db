                    <h1>What is a Palaeotsunami?</h1>
                    <p class="lead">A palaeotsunami is a tsunami that occurred in a place before written records existed at that location.</p>
                    <h2>How can we tell there's been a palaeotsunami?</h2>
                    <p>Evidence for palaeotsunamis commonly takes the form of unusual sediment deposits found in diverse
                        coastal areas. These deposits can range from boulders to fine mud, and often fine inland in response
                        to diminishing wave energy. Other forms of evidence include changes in geochemistry (e.g. some
                        sediment layers may be saltier than might otherwise be expected), microfossils (e.g. the unusual
                        presence of deep sea fossils found on land) and archaeological information (e.g. settlements
                        destroyed by extreme events such as a palaeotsunami). Scientists seek to identify, map and date
                        such deposits to build a record and understanding of palaeotsunamis through time.</p>
                    <h2>What do we look for?</h2>
                    <p>More than 30 criteria are currently used to recognise palaeotsunamis, although most studies will
                        use just a few to support their interpretations. The more characteristics we can recognise, the
                        more confident we can be that they were left by a palaeotsunami. A date is rarely however defined
                        to a specific year. Rather, an approximation of the age of an event generally improves as more
                        evidence becomes available from other sites. In contrast, historical tsunamis refer to events
                        that have happened since people have been around to write down details and they are usually talked
                        about in terms of when they happened (e.g. the Chilean tsunami in May 1960).</p>
                    <h2>How simple is it?</h2>
                    <p>In spite of our improving understanding about palaeotsunamis there are many factors which complicate
                        our interpretations. Coastlines may have moved over the hundreds or thousands of years since
                        the tsunami happened, so a given site may now be closer or further away from the sea than it
                        was when the tsunami occurred. Sediment layers can also be washed away by floods, erosion, human
                        activities and even more recent tsunamis. A lack of evidence, however, does not rule out past
                        (or future) tsunamis along a stretch of coast. While it might not always be possible to tell
                        exactly when a palaeotsunami happened or how far it travelled across the sea, learning about
                        such events is critical for understanding ongoing risks.</p>
